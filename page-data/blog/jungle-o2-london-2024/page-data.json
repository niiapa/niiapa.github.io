The shows of music and the people that vibe to them.\nIt's an experience I always loved in Accra, and it's something I always wanted to explore more of once I had the chance.\nAnd I'm glad that I did.</p>\n<blockquote>Jungle at the O2 was a solid 8.5 to 9 out of 10 for me...</blockquote>\n<p>And it's missing 1 point because I failed to secure standing tickets in time (it's hard to do a little shimmy when you're trapped betwixt two chairs).</p>\n<p>The other 0.5? For not performing \"House in LA\" üòî</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I have this curse of not having my favourite songs performed by the people I go see.</p>\n<p>Jungle is one of the bands that sounds phenomenal both in person and through your Spotify, or radio, or listening device.\n<i>Quick aside, phones used to have radios, and you could literally tune into FM/AM channels, and now we (or at least Spotify) refer to radios as playlists of similar songs... how the times change</i></p>\n<p>And they, Jungle, are phenomenal because they're one of the bands that sounds exactly like they sing on the record. And that, coupled\nwith the experience of being there, and appreciating it with a myriad of people, all doing their own little shimmy's, is fucking great.</p>\n<p>Plus the visuals!!! Props to the set designer üôåüèæ\nParcels is another band that does really good silhouette sets, and they're music is fire too so check them out if you ever get the chance.</p>\n<p>Listen, I love dancing, I love jams, I love silhouettes moving against a backlight.\nIf you give me the three combined in such tasteful quality, you've made me a happy man. So thank you guys.</p>\n<p>I took some photos, as I usually do. Enjoy them below, and thank you for reading this far üôÇ</p>\n<p><img src=\"./../images/jungle-concert/DSCF9729.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"./../images/jungle-concert/DSCF9730.JPG\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"./../images/jungle-concert/DSCF9732.JPG\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"./../images/jungle-concert/DSCF9734.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"./../images/jungle-concert/DSCF9736.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"./../images/jungle-concert/DSCF9737.JPG\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"./../images/jungle-concert/DSCF9750.JPG\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"./../images/jungle-concert/DSCF9753.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"./../images/jungle-concert/DSCF9754.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"./../images/jungle-concert/DSCF9761.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><small style=\"display:block;text-align: right;\"><small>Shot by me on Fujifilm x100V</small></small></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2024-09-13","formattedDate":"13 September 2024","path":"/blog/jungle-o2-london-2024","title":"Jungle at the O2"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3496355619","68838506"],"slicesMap":{}}
